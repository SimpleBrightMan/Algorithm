# 题目描述
[Beautiful Arrangement](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/discuss/)
```
Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement: 
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
Note:
The n and k are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.

# 分析
这题一开始还真没什么好的思路

其实解的方案，非常精妙。

就是大数与小数字穿插，后面为连续的整数。

就可以构造出题目中的要求。

感觉这还是一道智力题，主要是要思考出**构造策略**

```
if you have n number, the maximum k can be n - 1;
if n is 9, max k is 8.
This can be done by picking numbers interleavingly from head and tail,

// start from i = 1, j = n;
// i++, j--, i++, j--, i++, j--

1   2   3   4   5
  9   8   7   6
out: 1 9 2 8 3 7 6 4 5
dif:  8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Above is a case where k is exactly n - 1
When k is less than that, simply lay out the rest (i, j) in incremental
order(all diff is 1). Say if k is 5:

     i++ j-- i++ j--  i++ i++ i++ ...
out: 1   9   2   8    3   4   5   6   7
dif:   8   7   6   5    1   1   1   1 
```

# AC代码
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 1, j = n; i <= j; ) {
            if (k > 1) {
                res.push_back(k-- % 2 ? i++ : j--);
            }
            else {
                res.push_back(i++);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
